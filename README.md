# Commit Warehouse

Due to the nature of how https://github.com/docker-library/official-images works, we often need access to commits which have been rendered inaccessible due to force pushes to their relevant branches.  This repository is an attempt to combat that problem by archiving arch+repo+tag commits in Git tags so that they remain fetchable/accessible.
