# io.js Project Governance

## Working Group

The io.js docker project is jointly governed by a Working Group (WG)
which is responsible for high-level guidance of the project.

The WG has final authority over this project including:

* Technical direction
* Project governance and process (including this policy)
* Contribution policy
* GitHub repository hosting
* Conduct guidelines
* Maintaining the list of additional Collaborators

For the current list of WG members, see the project
[README.md](./README.md#people).

## Collaborators

The [iojs/docker-iojs](https://github.com/iojs/docker-iojs) GitHub repository is
maintained by the WG and additional Collaborators who are added by the
WG on an ongoing basis.

Individuals making significant and valuable contributions are made
Collaborators and given commit-access to the project. These
individuals are identified by the WG and their addition as
Collaborators is discussed as a pull request to this project's
[README.md](./README.md#people).

_Note:_ If you make a significant contribution and are not considered
for commit-access log an issue or contact a WG member directly.

Modifications of the contents of the iojs/docker-iojs repository are made on
a collaborative basis. Anybody with a GitHub account may propose a
modification via pull request and it will be considered by the project
Collaborators. All pull requests must be reviewed and accepted by a
Collaborator with sufficient expertise who is able to take full
responsibility for the change. In the case of pull requests proposed
by an existing Collaborator, an additional Collaborator is required
for sign-off. Consensus should be sought if additional Collaborators
participate and there is disagreement around a particular
modification. See _Consensus Seeking Process_ below for further detail
on the consensus model used for governance.

Collaborators may opt to elevate significant or controversial
modifications, or modifications that have not found consensus to the
WG for discussion by assigning the ***WG-agenda*** tag to a pull
request or issue. The WG should serve as the final arbiter where
required.

For the current list of Collaborators, see the project
[README.md](./README.md#people).

## WG Membership

WG seats are not time-limited. There is no fixed size of the WG.
However, the expected target is between 6 and 12, to ensure adequate
coverage of important areas of expertise, balanced with the ability to
make decisions efficiently.

There is no specific set of requirements or qualifications for WG
membership beyond these rules.

The WG may add additional members to the WG by unanimous consensus.

A WG member may be removed from the WG by voluntary resignation, or by
unanimous consensus of all other WG members in an issue or pull request
on the [iojs/docker-iojs](https://github.com/iojs/docker-iojs) repository

No more than 1/3 of the WG members may be affiliated with the same
employer. If removal or resignation of a WG member, or a change of
employment by a WG member, creates a situation where more than 1/3 of
the WG membership shares an employer, then the situation must be
immediately remedied by the resignation or removal of one or more WG
members affiliated with the over-represented employer(s).

## WG Meetings

This working group does not meet. All discussions and decisions happen
in the [iojs/docker-iojs](https://github.com/iojs/docker-iojs) repository
in issues and pull requests. Items can be flagged as needing a board
decision by **WG-agenda** tag to the issue.

When an issue is tagged with **WG-agenda**, The WG may invite persons or
representatives from certain projects to participate in the discussion in
a non-voting capacity.

## Consensus Seeking Process

The WG follows a
[Consensus Seeking](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Consensus-seeking_decision-making)
decision making model.

When an agenda item has appeared to reach a consensus the moderator
will ask "Does anyone object?" as a final call for dissent from the
consensus.

If an agenda item cannot reach a consensus a WG member can call for
a closing vote. The call for a vote must be seconded by a majority of the WG
or else the discussion will continue. Simple majority wins.

Note that changes to WG membership require unanimous consensus. See
"WG Membership" above.
